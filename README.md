# Rect-Color
Rect color is a tricky platformer where you take your character to the finish line in the least amount of time.
Made entirely with javascript.
Contains a Home page and 5 levels!



I wanted to site this person for teaching me about canvas and how to draw stuff on the canvas, thanks to his help I now feel more confident on making more new games completely from scratch.
